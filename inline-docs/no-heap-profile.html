<p>
This eventlog was generated without heap profiling.
</p>

<p>
To create a heap profile, you need to run the program with one of the <tt>+RTS
-h...</tt> options.  The <tt>-hT</tt> (closure type) and <tt>-hi</tt> (info
table) heap profiling options are available for all programs.  If you compile
with profiling enabled, more options are available.
